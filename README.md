## 🎯 Goal
Develop an AI capable of playing Tetris using a genetic algorithm to optimize its performance.

## 🧾 Description
This project implements a Tetris-playing AI using Python, leveraging a genetic algorithm to evolve strategies for improved gameplay. The AI learns to make decisions based on different game states, aiming to maximize the score by clearing lines efficiently. The project includes the core Tetris game logic, the genetic algorithm for evolving the AI, and various parameters and configurations for experimentation.
